# OWL docs intro

OWL stands for Organization of Warehouse Logistics. It is a web app used for creating bookings on warehouses.

Primarily, there are two types of users involved in this app: carriers and warehouse managers. Warehouse managers create warehouses and doors (ramps) on these warehouses, while carriers create bookings on these doors. Warehouse managers can then see and manage these bookings.

The primary environment for this kind of an app is a logistics warehouse (for example, a warehouse of a grocery store). Throughout the day, many trucks come into the warehouse from various distributors (so called "carriers"), wanting their cargo to be unloaded in the warehouse. The warehouse has a limited amount of employees and ramps (doors) where the trucks can unload their cargo. This means that in a poorly organized warehouse, the trucks will be waiting in the line in front of the warehouse ramps.

OWL helps this process by allowing warehouse managers to create time windows on ramps that the carriers can book. This way there will never be more than 1 carrier scheduled on one time window on that ramp per day. This is good both for carriers, because there is less waiting time for them on the ramps, and warehouse managers, because they can properly plan their day based on their reservations.
